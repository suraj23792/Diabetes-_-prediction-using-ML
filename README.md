# ***Diabetes Prediction Project***





# Description:

A simple machine learning project to predict diabetes using a Random Forest Classifier on medical data.


# Workflow:

1. Import libraries
2. Load data
3. Preprocess
4. Split Data (80% for training and 20% for testing)
5. Train Model (Random Forest Classifier)
6. Evaluate


 # Note: 
          A perfect score is rare and suggests the model should be tested on a larger, more complex dataset for a robust evaluation.


 # Technology Used:

                   1. Python
                   2. Pandas
                   3. Scikit-learn
                   4. Matplotlib
                   5. Seaborn
                   6. Jupyter Notebook
